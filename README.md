## Cooking game C# Edition

# About archiving the repo:

After 1 year development of the game, i first made the game using python at this link: https://github.com/nikeedev/cooking-game-csharp/. After seeing how idea and game grew, i decided to make C# version of it which lies in current repo. The game won't be updated any more, as well as the python version. 

The reason, is that after seeing how text-based games really are and how they work, i decided to stop developing the game, due to my disadvantage in making those type of games. I feel sorry for making this decision, but i have bad knowledge in making them.

Sincerly, Nikita, @nikeedev.
